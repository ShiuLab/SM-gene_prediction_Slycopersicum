# SM-gene_prediction_Slycopersicum
This repository will have all scripts and/or links to pipelines used for the SM gene prediction in S. lycopersicum paper

## Obtaining Features

### Domains

1. Map pfam domains to genes using their protein sequence using HMMER. 
    See https://github.com/bmmoore43/Tree_building/ for procedure.

2. Get a binary matrix using parsing script: 

        parse_domain-out_files_getmatrix.py <file with genes:Class> <domain.out file>
